### About

This page is mainly intended as main hub for all of my social media and CV links.
Besides, I may post some occasional rants here.

### Works

This part is under development, as I don't have any projects I can be really proud of. This page is probably the most practical of them.

### Art

If you think I've got some adequate art, you are seriously mistaken. 

### Other

Why is there so much text without that much meaning? I needed to test automatic menu generation (result should be on the left). If you don't have Javascript enabled, you will not see it. Another option is server-side rendering, but for that I would need to write a Ruby module.
