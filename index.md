### Test page chapter

I can write everything I want here. That horrible JS script should generate table of contents by itself.

### Another chapter

Available to PRESTO card and PRESTO Ticket customers only.

How it works:

Tap your PRESTO card or PRESTO Ticket on a card reader when you enter a subway station or board a vehicle.
Your fare will be deducted and a transfer will be applied to your card or ticket.
This transfer allows you to enter and exit the TTC as much as you’d like within a two hour period.
Tap your PRESTO card on a reader each time you enter a subway station and when you board a bus or streetcar. As long as you’re within two hours from your first tap, you won’t be charged another fare.

Now, let's try some Latex: \( a^2 \). Obviously, nothing works as intended because life would be too easy if it just did. Another edit.
