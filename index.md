### About

This page is mainly intended as main hub for all of my social media and CV links.
Besides, I may post some occasional rants here.

### Works

This part is under development, as I don't have any serious projects. This page is probably the most practical of them. So stay tuned.

### Art

I had some oil paintings in Kyiv, but left them all there, so there aren't any nice photos. Thank you Martin for suggesting idea for this chapter. 

### Other

Why is there so much text without that much meaning? I needed to test automatic menu generation (result should be on the left or on the top). If you don't have JavaScript enabled, you will not see it. Another option is server-side rendering, but for that I would need to write a Ruby module.
